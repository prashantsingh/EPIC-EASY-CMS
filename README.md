EPIC-EASY-CMS
=============

Welcome to EPIC EASY CMS<br/>
Version 2.0 Launched<br/>
THIS IS A TINY CMS THAT CAN BE USED TO POWER SMALL AND LIGHT SITE.<br/>
IF YOU KNOW PHP -> Bravo, you can help us extend this project.<br/>
IF YOU DON NOT KNOW PHP -> You are my friend coz it has been created for you only.<br/>
Lemme mention here few important things,<br/>
admin can be accessed by www.website.com/admin<br/>
It is not a full fledged CMS and can only serve as a basic system for hosting small scale to medium scale sites.<br/>
A bug that i am aware of is regarding caching problem in TinyMCE where after updating the page content the old content reappears again which is cached though changes are reflected in database... if you can solve this issue, please do a favour.<br/>
Menu is the list of categories.<br/>
A page (Post) must be linked to a particular category because it serves as navigation item in Navigation menu i.e. Navigation Menu is the list of categories and each category must be linked to a particular page. This is due to the fact that this CMS was created to serve blog.<br/>
A category can be assigned under other category.<br/>
Please refresh page each time by clicking on refresh button after each "Post Edit" and all Category Operations (Its not ajax based, so these drawbacks).<br/>
Logo can be changed in config file under admin directory.<br/>
Templating is yet not available, but one can replace index.php with any template by making changes in PHP code on top of index.php page. Only Menu function needs change, its everything is fine.<br/>
Admin directory has been password protected using .htaccess, please refer to following link to know more.(http://davidwalsh.name/password-protect-directory-using-htaccess)<br/>
Please leave the "powered by epic" in footer to give due credit.<br/>
